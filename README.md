# Job Agent

Note: This is just a showcase code and it shows snapshot of Sep 30,2026 Code and might not reflect later changes. Active repository is hidden so that deployments to the server stays secured.

A self-hosted AI assistant for the job search, running on a spare laptop with no cloud model and no API keys. Every night it reads around 13,000 postings from about 140 company career boards, scores each one against my resume, and prepares the applications worth sending: answers to every form question, a tailored resume and a cover letter. In the morning I review them in a web panel on my phone or laptop and approve or skip each one. Only the ones I approve are sent, by a browser script that fills the real form while I watch.

It also reads a dedicated inbox to track replies, keeps a timeline for every application, writes a weekly report on what's working, and includes a general assistant that can run commands on the server, each one only after I approve it.

![Home screen](docs/screenshots/home.png)

The data in every screenshot is made up for this showcase: the companies, jobs, emails and numbers are invented.

## What it does

- Finds jobs. `jobs.py` reads the public job board APIs of Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday and SmartRecruiters for a configured list of companies, discovers more companies through a local search engine, and reads four staffing agencies' listings. Titles, locations, experience and visa sponsorship are filtered in code before any model time is spent.
- Scores and prepares them. The local 4B model reads each posting and extracts its required skills and level into a fixed JSON schema; the score itself is computed in code from how many of those skills the resume has, the level and the years asked for, so it's consistent and explainable. The 8B model then drafts answers to the application's own questions. Facts come from a profile I fill in once (work authorization, education, links); only open-ended questions are drafted by the model, and they're marked for checking.
- Tailors documents. For each job it reorders my projects and skills by what the posting asks for, rewrites the resume summary without touching the bullets, drafts a cover letter, and flags any claim the resume doesn't support.
- Checks hiring rules before anything is sent: duplicates, company application caps, reapplying too soon after a rejection, graduation windows, AI-use policies (see [HIRING_RULES.md](HIRING_RULES.md)).
- Submits with a human in the loop. A userscript fills Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby and Workday forms in my own browser, only for applications I approved, and records exactly what was sent.
- Follows up. It reads the applications inbox over IMAP (read-only), recognizes confirmations, assessments, interview requests, rejections and sign-in codes, and moves each application along. Deadlines show as live countdowns.
- Reports. A weekly report counts what the search found, which kinds of jobs fit, which missing skills would widen the matches most, and reply rates by match strength. No model writes it; every suggestion shows the numbers it rests on.

## Engineering decisions

- Everything runs on a CPU. The host is an Intel Core i3 laptop with 16 GB of RAM, so model time is the budget. The 4B model handles high-volume work (reading postings, sorting email); the 8B writes drafts, and only for the strongest matches. Prompts are short and stable so Ollama's cache serves most of each one: a 1,011-token step took 1.7 seconds of prompt processing instead of about 30.
- The model never acts on its own. Its output is constrained to a JSON schema, and model output never becomes a URL, a request or a command without a person approving it. Email text reaches only a model with no tools and a fixed answer format.
- Least privilege by design. The web panel and the tools run as different Unix users, one narrow sudo rule connects them, and a firewall rule stops the tool user from reaching the panel, so an approved command can't approve the next one.
- It only uses public interfaces. The job search reads the same public board APIs that career pages use, checks robots.txt for the sites whose pages it reads, and leaves out sites whose terms forbid automated access or that only offer a private, keyed API.
- It deploys itself. A systemd timer pulls the private copy of this repository, checks syntax, backs up the running version, restarts the panel and rolls back automatically if the health check fails.
- The panel is fast and keyboard-first. Lists are cached in the browser and served with ETags, so an unchanged list costs a 304; reviewing is one key per job (`a` approve, `s` skip), the next job's details are prefetched, and on a phone it's a swipe.

## Background

This started as a general agent: a small model on a spare laptop that can act on the operating system through a handful of tools, with every action approved from my phone. The job search was built on top of it. The sections below cover the hardware, the benchmarks behind the design, the security model and how to run it.

The model never gets a free hand. For each task it proposes exactly one action as JSON, the action waits for my approval, the result goes back to the model, and the loop repeats until the model reports an answer. Reading files and listing directories run without asking, since they can't change anything. Shell commands, file writes, web fetches and web searches all stop for a decision.

## Hardware

The host is a Lenovo V15 G4 IRU that was sitting unused:

| Part | Spec |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Core i3-1315U (2 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores, 8 threads) |
| RAM | 16 GB DDR4-3200, dual channel (two 8 GB modules) |
| GPU | Intel UHD Graphics, unused for inference |
| Storage | 512 GB NVMe |
| OS | Ubuntu Server 24.04.5 LTS, headless |

There is no usable GPU, so everything runs on the CPU. Token generation on a CPU is limited by memory bandwidth, which is why confirming dual-channel RAM was the first hardware check.

## Benchmarks

All numbers are from Ollama's `--verbose` output on this laptop, using the same prompt (a Linux disk-usage question) with a fresh context each run.

Generation speed for Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 (Q4_K_M) by thread count:

| Threads | Tokens per second |
|---|---|
| 2 | 9.90 |
| 4 | 10.58 |
| 6 | 10.85 |
| 8 | 11.83 |

Qwen3 8B (Q4_K_M, thinking off) at 8 threads generated 6.54 tokens per second. The 4B runs almost twice as fast, so it is the default, and the approval step catches its mistakes.

Prompt processing ran at about 30 tokens per second on 520- and 934-token prompts. That makes prompt size the main cost of an agent step: a cold 1,000-token prompt takes around 30 seconds before the first output token. Ollama's prompt cache removes most of it. In one run, 974 of a 1,011-token prompt were cached, and the step's prompt processing took 1.7 seconds.

In real use, most agent steps took 4 to 16 seconds. Steps that fed long command output back to the model took 23 to 39 seconds, which led to the output limits described below.

CPU temperature idled at 42 to 44°C, sat at 67 to 77°C while generating, and peaked at 83°C during the benchmarks. The chip throttles near 100°C.

## How it works

`agent.py` holds the core: the system prompt, the tools, the model call and a terminal version of the loop. The model is called with Ollama's structured output option and a JSON schema, so every reply is a valid object with a one-sentence `thought`, a `tool` name and an `arg`. The tools are:

- `run_shell` runs a bash command in the workspace directory, with a 120-second timeout
- `read_file` and `list_dir` read from the filesystem and are auto-approved
- `write_file` overwrites a file, and the approval prompt shows a preview of the content
- `fetch_url` downloads a page and strips it to text
- `web_search` queries a local SearXNG instance and returns the top five results
- `finish` ends the task with an answer, or with a question back to me

Several design choices come straight from the benchmarks. The system prompt is short and never changes, so it stays in Ollama's cache. Tool output is cut to 2,000 characters before the model sees it, and stderr gets a separate 400-character budget, because a few dozen "Permission denied" lines were once enough to double a step's time. Only the last five action and result pairs stay in context. Each task is capped at 15 steps.

`server.py` is a FastAPI app that serves the control panel (`panel.html`, `panel.css`, `panel.js`, plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no framework or build step): Home, Jobs, Applications, Inbox, Agencies, Insights, Assistant and Settings. On a laptop it has three panes, a sidebar, a list and the open item, with single-key shortcuts; on a phone it stacks, with a bottom tab bar, and an item opens full screen. Everything is drawn with `textContent`, so nothing from a job board, an email or the model can become HTML. Chat is a plain conversation with the 8B model (or the 4B for speed): replies stream in as they're written, conversations are saved, and there are no tools, so nothing needs approval. Memory is a short list of facts about me that goes at the start of every chat and task; I edit it under You, Memory, or say "remember that ..." in a chat. Tasks runs the tool loop above in a background thread. Both Chat and Tasks take attached files (text of any kind, PDFs with a text layer, Word .docx): in Chat the file's text goes into the message, up to 16,000 characters, and the page shows how long the model will take to read it; in Tasks the file is saved into the agent's workspace so commands can work on it. When the model proposes an action that needs approval, the loop blocks until I tap Approve or Deny on the phone. A denial can carry a reason, which goes back to the model as the tool result, and that is how I steer it. The panel polls the server every 1.5 seconds and is installed on the phone as a home-screen web app. It sends Web Push notifications when an action needs approval and when a task finishes or fails. The push payload is encrypted end to end, so Apple's push service relays it without being able to read it.

`toolrunner.py` is a short helper that executes one tool as the unprivileged `agent` user. The server calls it through sudo, which is the core of the security model.

`jobs.py` is a job search that runs overnight inside the panel process. It reads the public job board APIs of Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby, plus Workday and SmartRecruiters, and the job listings of four staffing agencies (TEKsystems, Apex Systems, Randstad and Insight Global), which most banks, insurers, hospitals and universities use, for a list of companies, finds more companies through site-restricted SearXNG searches, and drops postings whose title, location, required years or citizenship and clearance requirements don't fit. For each remaining posting, the 4B model lists the required skills and the seniority level, in about 20 seconds, and code scores the fit: how many of those skills appear as phrases in my resume, whether the level is new grad to mid, the years asked for, and whether the company sponsors visas. Asked for a fit score directly, the 4B gave nearly every software role 85. For the strongest matches, the 8B model drafts answers to the form's open questions (the 4B invented project details in testing; the 8B stuck to the resume). Factual answers such as name, contact details and work authorization come from a profile file, never from the model. A push notification each morning lists the new matches, and a Jobs view in the panel shows each one with its score, the skills it matched and missed, the prepared answers, and a link to the application. A userscript fills the application form itself (see below). It never submits an application: the Greenhouse and Lever application forms are behind reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha, and forms include legal agreements that I should read myself.

The panel listens only on `127.0.0.1:8000`. `tailscale serve` publishes it over HTTPS to devices signed into my tailnet and nowhere else.

## Security model

The model can be wrong, and it can be manipulated by text it reads from web pages or files. The design assumes both.

Every action with side effects needs a human decision. The approval card shows the exact command, file path and content, so what I approve is exactly what runs.

The server and the tools run as different users. The server runs as `agentd`, which holds the approval state, the action log and the push signing key in a home directory the agent can't read. Tools run as `agent`, which has no sudo rights and owns only its workspace. The sudoers rule lets `agentd` run one program as one user and nothing else:

```
agentd ALL=(agent) NOPASSWD: /opt/agent/venv/bin/python /opt/agent/toolrunner.py *
```

An approved command can't approve itself. Firewall rules matched on user ID reject any connection from the `agent` user to port 8000 on loopback and to every Tailscale address, so a command can't send a fake approval to the panel, either directly or through `tailscale serve` on the machine's own tailnet address. Tailscale's own connection to the panel runs as root and is unaffected.

The code in `/opt/agent` belongs to my own account, so neither service user can modify it.

Web search needs approval too, even though it only reads. A search query leaves the machine, and a model that has just read a hostile page could be talked into putting private data in one.

Every action, approved or not, is appended to `/home/agentd/actions.jsonl`, which logrotate keeps for 12 weeks.

The job search is the one part that reaches the network without an approval. It is plain code, not the tool loop: it only sends requests to URLs it builds itself, to the job board APIs and the local SearXNG, from the company names and search phrases in its config. From search results it keeps only the company name, and only when the result's URL matches one of the three job board hosts. Model output never becomes a URL or request data, and my resume and profile never leave the machine. They live in `/home/agentd/jobs`, which the `agent` user can't read.

```

## Setup

These steps assume Ubuntu Server 24.04 with SSH access and Tailscale already running on the machine and on your phone.

1. Install Ollama, apply the service override and build the model:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d
   sudo cp deploy/ollama-override.conf /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart ollama
   ollama pull hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:Q4_K_M
   ollama create agent-4b -f deploy/Modelfile.agent
   ```

   Set `num_thread` in the Modelfile to whatever benchmarks best on your CPU.

2. Create the two service users and the workspace:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" agent
   sudo adduser --system --group --home /home/agentd agentd
   sudo chmod 750 /home/agentd
   sudo -u agent mkdir -p /home/agent/workspace
   ```

3. Install the code and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/agent && sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /opt/agent
   cp agent.py server.py toolrunner.py jobs.py panel.html panel.css panel.js /opt/agent/
   python3 -m venv /opt/agent/venv
   /opt/agent/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add the sudo rule and check the syntax before closing the terminal:

   ```bash
   sudo cp deploy/sudoers-agentd /etc/sudoers.d/agentd
   sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/agentd
   sudo visudo -c
   ```

5. Run SearXNG for web search, bound to localhost with JSON output turned on:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y docker.io
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/searxng
   SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   printf 'use_default_settings: true\nserver:\n  secret_key: "%s"\n  limiter: false\n  image_proxy: false\nsearch:\n  formats:\n    - html\n    - json\n' "$SECRET" | sudo tee /opt/searxng/settings.yml > /dev/null
   sudo docker run -d --name searxng --restart unless-stopped \
     -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8080 -v /opt/searxng:/etc/searxng \
     docker.io/searxng/searxng:latest
   ```

6. Install the firewall rule and the panel service. Apple's push service requires a contact address from every sender, so replace `you@example.com` with your own address before running this:

   ```bash
   sudo cp deploy/agent-firewall.service deploy/agent-web.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/agent-web.service.d
   printf '[Service]\nEnvironment="AGENT_PUSH_SUB=mailto:you@example.com"\n' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/agent-web.service.d/local.conf
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now agent-firewall agent-web
   sudo cp deploy/logrotate-agent /etc/logrotate.d/agent
   ```

7. Publish the panel on your tailnet. HTTPS certificates need to be turned on in the Tailscale admin console under DNS.

   ```bash
   sudo tailscale serve --bg 8000
   tailscale serve status
   ```

8. On an iPhone, open the address from `tailscale serve status` in Safari, add it to the home screen, open it from the icon, and tap Alerts. Web Push on iOS works only for home-screen web apps, on iOS 16.4 or later.

To check the isolation, run `sudo -u agent curl -s -m 3 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/state; echo $?`. It should print `7` (connection refused). Then ask the agent to run `whoami`; it should report `agent`.

The terminal version still works for testing at the keyboard. It runs everything as `agent` and logs to `/home/agent/actions.jsonl`:

```bash
sudo -u agent -H /opt/agent/venv/bin/python /opt/agent/agent.py
```

## Updating from GitHub

The server deploys itself from the `main` branch of a private copy of this repository. A systemd timer on the laptop runs `deploy/agent-update.sh` every 5 minutes. Nothing on GitHub connects to the laptop; the laptop pulls, so no inbound access is needed and GitHub holds no secrets for it.

That copy is private, so the server pulls over SSH with a read-only deploy key: a key that can read this one repository and nothing else, and can't push. The private half stays in `/root/.ssh/agent-deploy` on the server.

When `main` has a commit that isn't deployed yet, the script:

1. Postpones the deploy if the agent is in the middle of a task, and tries again on the next run.
2. Checks the Python files for syntax errors and refuses to deploy if any fail.
3. Backs up the live files to `/opt/agent-backups` (the 10 newest are kept).
4. Runs `pip install` if `requirements.txt` changed.
5. Copies the files into `/opt/agent` and restarts the panel.
6. Waits up to 20 seconds for the panel to answer. If it doesn't, the script restores the backup, restarts again, and marks the commit as bad so it isn't retried. The next commit to `main` is tried normally.

Only `agent.py`, `server.py`, `toolrunner.py`, `jobs.py`, `requirements.txt` and the panel files (`panel.html`, `panel.css`, `panel.js`) are deployed automatically. Files under `deploy/` change root-level configuration (sudo rules, systemd units, firewall), so the script only reports that they changed. Apply those by hand after reviewing them.

Anyone who can push to `main` can change the code this machine runs, so the GitHub account needs two-factor authentication.

One-time setup on the server. First create the deploy key and print its public half:

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -C "agent deploy (read-only)" -f /root/.ssh/agent-deploy
sudo cat /root/.ssh/agent-deploy.pub
```

Add that line on GitHub under the repository's Settings, Deploy keys, Add deploy key, with "Allow write access" left unticked. Then trust GitHub's host key, clone and install the timer:

```bash
sudo sh -c "ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts"
sudo ssh-keygen -lf /root/.ssh/known_hosts -F github.com
```

The fingerprint must be `SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU`, the one [GitHub publishes](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints). If it isn't, remove the line from `/root/.ssh/known_hosts` and stop.

```bash
sudo git -c core.sshCommand="ssh -i /root/.ssh/agent-deploy -o IdentitiesOnly=yes" clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER/YOUR-PRIVATE-REPO.git /opt/agent-src
sudo git -C /opt/agent-src config core.sshCommand "ssh -i /root/.ssh/agent-deploy -o IdentitiesOnly=yes"
sudo install -m 755 /opt/agent-src/deploy/agent-update.sh /usr/local/sbin/agent-update
sudo cp /opt/agent-src/deploy/agent-update.service /opt/agent-src/deploy/agent-update.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chown -R root:root /opt/agent
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now agent-update.timer
sudo systemctl start agent-update
journalctl -u agent-update -n 20 --no-pager
```

After this, `/opt/agent` belongs to root and changes go through Git. To deploy right away instead of waiting for the timer, run `sudo systemctl start agent-update`. Deploy history is in `journalctl -u agent-update`.

To roll back by hand, copy a folder from `/opt/agent-backups` into `/opt/agent` and restart `agent-web`, or push a revert commit.

If a clone made before the repository went private is still set to HTTPS, create the key and trust GitHub's host key as above, then switch it over:

```bash
sudo git -C /opt/agent-src config core.sshCommand "ssh -i /root/.ssh/agent-deploy -o IdentitiesOnly=yes"
sudo git -C /opt/agent-src remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR-USER/YOUR-PRIVATE-REPO.git
sudo systemctl start agent-update
```

A deploy run that fails with "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'" means the clone is still on HTTPS. "Permission denied (publickey)" means the deploy key is missing from GitHub or was removed there.

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables, set in the systemd unit or a drop-in file.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_MODEL` | `agent-4b` | Ollama model name |
| `AGENT_OWNER` | `Sai` | Name the model uses for you in its prompt |
| `AGENT_WORKSPACE` | `/home/agent/workspace` | Working directory for tools |
| `AGENT_LOG` | `/home/agent/actions.jsonl` | Action log |
| `AGENT_SEARXNG` | `http://127.0.0.1:8888` | SearXNG base URL |
| `AGENT_USE_TOOLRUNNER` | unset | `1` runs tools as the agent user through sudo |
| `AGENT_VAPID_KEY` | `/home/agent/vapid_private.pem` | Push signing key, created on first start |
| `AGENT_PUSH_SUBS` | `/home/agent/push_subscriptions.json` | Saved push subscriptions |
| `AGENT_PUSH_SUB` | `mailto:agent@example.com` | Contact address sent to push services |
| `AGENT_ALLOWED_LOGIN` | unset | If set, only this Tailscale login may use the panel |
| `AGENT_JOBS_DIR` | `/home/agentd/jobs` | Job search config, profile, resume and results |
| `AGENT_CHAT_MODEL` | `qwen3:8b` | Model for the chat tab's "8B, better" setting |
| `AGENT_CHATS` | `/home/agentd/chats.json` | Saved chat conversations |
| `AGENT_MEMORY` | `/home/agentd/memory.md` | Facts added to every chat and task |

Tools that run without approval are listed in `AUTO_APPROVE` in `agent.py`.

## Job search setup

The job search stays off until its folder has a config and a resume. As your admin user on the server, with `profile.json` and `resume.txt` copied into the home directory first:

```bash
sudo install -d -o agentd -g agentd -m 700 /home/agentd/jobs
sudo install -o agentd -g agentd -m 600 /opt/agent-src/deploy/jobs-config.example.json /home/agentd/jobs/config.json
sudo install -o agentd -g agentd -m 600 ~/profile.json ~/resume.txt /home/agentd/jobs/
```

Then fill in You, Application profile in the panel: every field application forms ask for, grouped as Name, Contact, Links, Work authorization, Experience, Education, Job preferences and optional self-identification, built from the questions on real application forms. Below the fields it lists the questions it still can't answer, most common first; answer one once and every form that asks it gets that answer. An empty field makes the matching form question show up as one to answer yourself. Legal consents are never answered for you. Edit `config.json` to change roles, companies (board names as they appear in the job board URLs; for Workday, `<tenant>.wdN/<site>` from a URL like `https://mtb.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/MTB/job/...`, and for SmartRecruiters the company name from `https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/<company>/...`), the run and digest times, and the score thresholds; the next run picks up the change without a restart. The first run happens at the next `run_at` time, or right away from Run now in the Jobs view.

Each run can score up to 300 postings (`max_scored_per_run`), about 100 minutes of model time at 20 seconds each, and the rest wait for the next night. It then drafts answers for up to 60 strong matches (`max_drafts_per_run`), about 2 minutes each with the 8B, so a full run ends around 5 a.m. Other jobs can be drafted on demand with Prepare answers on their card. Panel tasks take priority: the job search waits whenever a task is running.

### Autofill

Copy the resume PDF into the jobs folder as `resume.pdf` (owned by `agentd`, mode 600, like the other files). Then install the userscript from the Jobs view (Autofill script):

- iPhone: install the free Userscripts app from the App Store, turn it on in Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions and allow it on greenhouse.io, lever.co and ashbyhq.com, then open the Autofill script link in Safari and install it.
- Mac: install Tampermonkey (Chrome) or Userscripts (Safari), then open the Autofill script link.

To give the agent its own inbox, make a new Yahoo or Gmail address and create an app password for it (Yahoo: Account Info, Account Security, Generate app password; Gmail: turn on 2-step verification, then Google Account, Security, App passwords), and connect it in the Inbox tab. It becomes the email on your applications. Every 5 minutes the panel reads new mail without marking it read: an "application received" email marks the job Applied, interview requests and rejections move the job to Interviewing or Rejected, and verification codes appear in the list and as an alert. The local model reads each email and sorts it: application received, assessment, interview request, interview scheduled, offer, rejection, action needed or recruiter outreach, with a one-line summary, any deadline and any interview time. Assessments, interviews, offers and action items go on a Needs you list at the top of the Inbox, each with an Open in Gmail link, until you mark them done, and they send an alert with the deadline or time. The model gets the email with no tools and can only answer in that fixed form, which is shown as plain text; links in emails are never opened. The bell in the phone's top bar, or the sidebar button on a laptop, turns alerts on; on iPhone they work only in the home-screen app.

Each morning the Jobs view opens on Review: up to 50 prepared applications (`queue_size`) on Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby, best first. Open one, check the answers, fill in what's missing, tick the statements you agree to (each consent has its own box, or use Agree to all), and tap Approve. Then tap Apply to approved: it opens each approved form in your browser, fills it, ticks the consents you agreed to, and submits it after a 3-second countdown you can stop. After the confirmation it marks the job Applied and opens the next one. It stops and hands over when a CAPTCHA appears, a required question has no answer, or no confirmation comes; fix it and tap the form's Submit button and it carries on, or skip that job for now.

For a tailored resume and cover letter per job, put your resume in the jobs folder as `resume.json` (see `deploy/jobs-resume.example.json`; owned by `agentd`, mode 600). Each night, for the jobs it can submit, the agent orders your projects and skills by what the job asks for and rewrites the summary, without changing your bullets. It also drafts a cover letter. A summary that claims a skill your resume doesn't list is thrown away, and a cover letter that does gets a warning on the job. Open both PDFs from the job's Resume and cover letter section, edit the summary or the letter there, and approve. The autofill attaches them to the matching upload fields. The Review list only shows applications with all three ready: answers, resume and cover letter. Each night the agent gets the best matches ready first, and stops at 7:50 so the list is settled for the 8:00 alert. Matches still being prepared are counted at the top of Review, and Get them ready now does it on demand. Every application is also checked against hiring rules: the same posting twice or a repost, too many at one company (3 in 30 days by default, Google 3 in 90), unrelated roles at one company, reapplying within 180 days of a rejection after interviews, applying while interviewing there, graduation windows you're outside of, citizenship or clearance requirements, no sponsorship, different answers or resumes to one company, AI-use policies, and referrals or agency submissions you noted. Blocked jobs stay out of Review and Apply with the reason shown; others ask you to confirm with Approve anyway or show a note. Set each rule and the per-company caps under You, Rules. [HIRING_RULES.md](HIRING_RULES.md) lists every rule, what breaks it and its default action. The Applications tab lists everything I've applied to, with totals (applied, interviewing, offers, rejections, how many heard back, this week), a status bar, search and filters. Opening one shows its timeline, from approval and submission through every email, and the application exactly as it went out: each question and answer, the statements agreed to, and the resume and cover letter PDFs. The autofill records the form right before Submit; applications sent another way get a copy rebuilt from the prepared answers, labeled as such. Workday jobs go through Review too. Workday needs an account at every company, so set one password under You, Workday: the autofill creates each company's account with your applications email the first time and signs in after that (Workday usually emails a verification link, which shows up in Inbox). It opens each job with Apply Manually rather than Workday's Autofill with Resume, whose resume parser gets titles, dates and schools wrong, and fills My Experience itself from `resume.json`: one entry per job (title, company, location, dates, and your bullets as the description), one per degree (school, degree, field of study, GPA from the profile, years), your GitHub and website under Websites, and your skills where Workday's list has them. It only fills empty fields and never adds an entry twice, so a company account that already has your history keeps it. It fills each page and uses Save and Continue, and submits approved applications on the Review page. Agency jobs (Jobs, Agencies) are applied to by hand on the agency's site, so each night the best 40 get answers, a tailored resume and a cover letter after the Review list, and the list only shows ones that are ready: open one, download the PDFs, apply, and tap Mark applied. A running search can be stopped with the stop button in the Jobs header.

On a Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby or Workday application page, tap Fill from agent. SmartRecruiters forms aren't supported; for those, copy answers from the job's card in the Jobs view. It fills text fields, dropdowns and yes/no questions from the answers prepared for that job (or from `profile.json` for any other job on those sites), attaches the resume, and outlines each field: green filled, blue a draft to read, orange for you. Consents, legal and demographic questions, and anything it has no answer for stay empty. Check everything, solve the CAPTCHA, submit, and tap Mark applied. It needs Tailscale on, since it asks the panel for the answers.

## Running a laptop as a server

A few things this particular laptop needed, which may save time on similar hardware:

- Closing the lid suspends the machine by default. A logind drop-in with `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` and masking the sleep targets keeps it running.
- Lenovo's airplane-mode setting survived the switch from Windows and left the Wi-Fi radio soft-blocked (`ideapad_wlan` in `/sys/class/rfkill`). Writing `0` to the `soft` files cleared it.
- Intel Wi-Fi power saving made SSH sessions sluggish. `deploy/wifi-powersave-off.service` turns it off at boot.
- Lenovo's battery conservation mode, at `/sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode`, caps charging to protect a battery that stays plugged in.
- With `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1`, every model loaded during benchmarking stayed in memory until 11 GB of 16 were in use. `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1` prevents that.
- Unattended upgrades with an automatic 4 a.m. reboot keep kernel security fixes applied.

## Limitations

A 4B model makes confident mistakes. During testing it suggested `sort -hr | tail -5` to find the five largest directories, which returns the five smallest, and it once ranked 16K above 32K. The system prompt now tells it to let commands do sorting and arithmetic, which fixed those cases, but the approval step is the real safeguard, and reading each command before approving it is part of using this.

Each task starts with an empty context apart from the memory list, so the agent remembers nothing else between tasks. Chat keeps its conversation, but only the most recent 12,000 characters are sent to the model. Only one task runs at a time. Stopping a task takes effect after the current model call returns, which can take up to half a minute.

The CPU does all the work, so a task that needs many steps or reads long output takes minutes. The 8B model gives better answers at half the speed, and switching to it is a one-line change to `AGENT_MODEL`.
